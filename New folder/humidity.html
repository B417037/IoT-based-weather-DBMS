                This DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor features a calibrated digital signal output with the temperature and humidity sensor capability. It is integrated  with a high-performance 8-bit microcontroller. Its technology ensures the high reliability and excellent long-term stability.  This sensor includes a resistive element and a sensor for wet NTC temperature measuring devices. It has excellent quality, fast response, anti-interference ability and high performance.

                Each DHT11 sensors features extremely accurate calibration of humidity calibration chamber. The calibration coefficients stored in the OTP program memory, internal sensors detect signals in the process, we should call these calibration coefficients. The single-wire serial interface system is integrated to become quick and easy. Small size, low power, signal transmission distance up to 20 meters, enabling a variety of applications and even the most demanding ones. The product is 4-pin single row pin package. Convenient connection, special packages can be provided according to users need.
